MITM Algorithm
==============
This is a reimplementation of the MITM-Algorithm by Amy et. al:
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0758]

Note that we cannot claim the same speed, but this was implemented using
xtensor, so installation should be easier.

Requirements
------------
Ths project is based on the xtensor libary for matrix multiplication,
hence you need to install:

* `xtensor`
* `xtensor-blas`
* `xtl`
* `xtensor-python`




Installation Python package
------------


 - clone this repository
 - `pip install ./xtensor-example-extension`



Development Notes
--------------------------

In case you want to contribute/improve performance, this project uses
Cmake for development.
